Our main goal is to excite students about science and to provide fun, memorable hands-on demonstrations that the students would not normally have access to as part of their school curriculum. Graduate student coordinators run this successful program, founded in 1995, and the SLRI Research Training Centre provides administrative support.

The Academy is also developing new relationships with Ontario universities and national energy and research organizations.  Its expanded outreach activities will ensure that more students are aware of the opportunity to advance their interests and abilities in research, and more institutions, and their researchers, will become mentors.\\nThe Deep River Science Academy introduces high school students to real research under the mentorship of researchers in industrial and institutional laboratories.  Volunteer scientists and engineers, along with undergraduate university students mentor pairs of high school students.  During the six-week summer program the students are exposed to all aspects of research, including the building of equipment, performing experiments, analyzing the data and communicating their results and experience.',\n",
